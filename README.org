** Requirements and the Learning Outcomes

The requirements and the outcome for the lecture are given as follows.

The student should be comfortable with working with either python and/or C++ and
should have an beginner level knowledge of the Linux environment and
the command line interface

For a revision on some of these topics please look at the following repos:

** Grading of the Lecture

The lecture will have one (1) personal assignment which will be based on ROS and
programming related to it.
      
| ASSIGNMENT TYPE     | VALUE |
| Personal Assignment |   100 |
| SUM                 |   100 |

** Lecture Sources

The following are a table of documentation which are useful resources which
goes well with the lectures.

| Programming Principles and Practice using C++         | B. Stroustrup | Addison Wesley (2014) |

** Content and Unit Distribution

The content and unit distribution of the lecture is as follows where a unit
is defined as 45 min lecture.

| TOPIC                             | UNITS | SELF STUDY |
| The GNU/Linux Operating System    |     3 |          6 |
| ROS 2 Introduction and Concepts   |     3 |          6 |
| Programming with Client Libraries |     6 |         12 |
| Simulations and TF Trees          |     3 |          6 |
| SUM                               |    15 |         30 |

** Structure per Session

The structure of Robotics can be
grouped into four (4) parts:

1. The GNU/Linux Operating System    
2. ROS 2 Introduction and Concepts   
3. Programming with Client Libraries 
4. Simulations and TF Trees  

Below is the detailed structure of the lecture.
