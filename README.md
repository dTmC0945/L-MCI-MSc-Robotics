# Introduction

Welcome to the lecture materials for the course, M.Sc Robotics, held at MCI IV. This lecture covers a lot of topics
related to robotics, such as a brief introduction to the concept of robotics, their hardware, and a general overview on 
what kind of software we need to know to design robots.

> [!WARNING]
> This lecture assumes you are comfortable looking and writing C++. If you need
> a refreshment, please have a look at the Cpp Lecture slides which covers the essential points
> you need to start ROS 2 programming ball rolling.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This lecture is one (1) SWS and has **one assignment** and there will be no exam.

ALl lecture materials for this course will be published here. So please check here for most up-to-date material.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All .pdf files are password protected and to decrypt them, a password will be provided to you in SAKAI as an announcement.

> [!NOTE]
> This lecture will be predominantly self-studied. The initial lecture will follow a standard format and once
> the topic shifts focus to programming (i.e., Linux/ROS 2) you will follow curated documents with detailed instructions
> to learn by practice.
